# Hey, I'm Lucas ðŸ‘‹

I'm a quantitative social scientist with a background in political psychology looking to improve how private business and public institutions communicate and disseminate data with the public. I have experience inside and outside of academia. I started programming for a masterâ€™s thesis that examined campaign effects on Facebook and have not stopped coding since. 

I have worked on Canadian elections in both public service and academic roles. I am always interested in working on projects related to elections and the strengthening of Canadian democracy. Most recently, I have been freelancing as a researcher and data analyst. My current project is a for-profit startup related to sustainability.
