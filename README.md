# Hey, I'm Lucas ðŸ‘‹

I'm a quantitative social scientist with a background in political psychology looking to improve how governments communicate and disseminate data with the public. I have experience inside and outside of academia. I started programming for a masters thesis that examined campaign effects on Facebook - I haven't stopped coding since. 

Recently finished work on the [Canadian Elections Database](http://canadianelectionsdatabase.ca/PHASE5/). Looking forward to sharing more about this project soon. (I am still working on Canadian elections in other capacities and am always interested in joining projects related to elections and Canadian democracy). Currently working for a non-profit organization dedicated to addressing climate change.
